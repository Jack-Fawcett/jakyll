<br /><br />Hired into Cognizant’s graduate scheme in London from university. Promoted to Associate in the Artificial Intelligence and Analytics department.
Lead a team for a UK energy company to detect theft of energy through smart meter data implementing ingestion, storage, orchestration and scoring of big data through an operationalised rules engine within Hadoop.

Applied Machine Learning to design oil rigs for a Norwegian engineering company which showed promising results and gave funding to expand the team from 3 to 15 to operationalise the algorithm. Wrote a genetic algorithm from the ground up in C# and deployed at scale in Azure making use of parallel cloud computing. Optimised several production oil rigs with designs that otherwise would not have been implemented by chartered engineers.
Added value to a Global Stock Transfer Company by designing and modelling SQL server analysis databases with data ingestion and cleansing from many data sources to form a valid source for use in dashboard analytics. Optimised DAX query performance for responsiveness to user filtering. Produced and deployed Power BI dashboards.
